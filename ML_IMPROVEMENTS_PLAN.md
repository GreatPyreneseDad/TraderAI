predictor = TimeSeriesEnsemblePredictor(use_gpu=True)
features = predictor.create_features(market_data)
predictor.fit(features, targets)
```

### Step 3: Add FinBERT Sentiment
```python
# In sentiment analysis module
from ml_enhancements.finbert_sentiment import FinBERTSentimentAnalyzer

# Replace existing sentiment with FinBERT
analyzer = FinBERTSentimentAnalyzer()
sentiment_results = analyzer.analyze_batch(news_texts)
```

### Step 4: Enable MLflow Tracking
```python
# In training scripts
from ml_enhancements.mlops_manager import MLOpsManager

mlops = MLOpsManager()
mlops.log_model_training(
    model=predictor,
    model_type="ensemble",
    params=hyperparameters,
    metrics=performance_metrics,
    features=feature_names
)
```
